# Graphql Codegen

## Intro

TBD

## Setup
Somewhere on your application (probably in config.py)
add our codegen configurations.
```python
# myapp/config.py
from qtgql.codegen.py.config import QtGqlConfig
from pathlib import Path

myconfig = QtGqlConfig(url="http://localhost:8000/graphql",
                       output=Path.cwd().parent / '__generated.py'
                       )
```
Now in your `pyproject.toml` add the full import path
for `myconfig`:

```yaml
[ tool.qtgql ]
config = "myapp.config:myconfig"
```
Now `qtgql` knows how to query your server for
introspection data, you just need to call

<div class="termy">

```console

// Make sure the server is on ðŸ˜‰

$ poetry run qtgql gen

---> 100%
```

</div>

And your typed are generated...

## Note about optionals
This library will try to set default values for fields if they were not fetched by the query
or to be used by `QGraphQListModel.currentObject`,
This reduces unexpected bugs significantly.

!!! Note
    Object types are currently optional because two types
    can refer each-other and cause recursion error, see [#84](https://github.com/nrbnlulu/qtgql/issues/84)

```qml
Item{
    property int size: object?.size
}
```
If `object` would be null property assignment would fail since
you can't assign `undefined` to `int`.

Therefore, **every generated type** has a default value,
including scalars and custom-scalars.
